This repository gives two simple implementations for:
HVAC and Appliance Monitoring agent:
  We can employ AI agents built off real-time data and existing model (built on historic data) to monitor important appliances.
  By monitoring these appliances and other structural elements of the building, it is possible to predict when the system might fail and need repairs.
Building Monitoring AI Agent:
  An agent composed of different agents to monitor an entire building and give real-time updates about the health of the building or the property.
